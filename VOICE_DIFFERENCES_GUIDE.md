## 🔍 Troubleshooting Voice Differences

### "All voices sound the same!"

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Browser Limitations**
   - Some browsers have limited voice variety
   - **Solution**: Use Chrome or Edge for best results

2. **System Voices**
   - Your computer might have limited voices installed
   - **Solution**: The pitch and rate adjustments will still make them different

3. **Volume Too Low**
   - Subtle differences harder to hear at low volume
   - **Solution**: Turn up volume to hear pitch differences clearly

4. **Not Waiting for Full Preview**
   - Clicking too quickly between tests
   - **Solution**: Let each voice finish speaking before testing next

### "I can't tell the difference between similar voices"

**Try This:**

1. **Test Extreme Opposites First**
   ```
   OpenAI Onyx (0.7 pitch) vs OpenAI Shimmer (1.35 pitch)
   = HUGE difference!
   ```

2. **Focus on One Characteristic**
   - First, listen for PITCH (high vs low)
   - Then, listen for SPEED (fast vs slow)

3. **Use Headphones**
   - Subtle differences more noticeable with headphones
