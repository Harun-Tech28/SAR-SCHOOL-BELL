# How to Install Offline Voices for Windows

The School Bell System uses the voices installed on your computer for offline announcements. By default, Windows comes with a few voices (like David and Zira), but you can install many more high-quality voices for free using Windows Language Packs.

## ⚠️ Important: No Direct Download Link
**There is no official direct download link (like an .exe file) for these voices.**
Modern Windows voices are deeply integrated into the operating system and are **only** distributed through Windows Update. You must use the Windows Settings app to install them.

## 🚀 Quick Shortcut
Instead of navigating through menus, you can open the exact settings page immediately:

1.  Press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard.
2.  Paste this command: `ms-settings:speech`
3.  Click **OK**.
4.  This will open the **Speech** settings where you can click **"Add voices"**.

## Step 1: Open Windows Settings (Manual Way)

## Step 2: Add a Language
1.  Click on **Language** (or "Language & region" in Windows 11).
2.  Click **Add a language**.
3.  Search for the language you want (e.g., "English (United Kingdom)", "English (India)", "English (Australia)").
4.  **Important**: When selecting the language, make sure the **Text-to-speech** icon (a microphone or speech bubble) is shown next to it.
5.  Click **Next**.
6.  Ensure the **Text-to-speech** checkbox is checked.
7.  Click **Install**.

## Step 3: Wait for Installation
Windows will now download and install the language pack and the associated voices. This may take a few minutes. You might need to restart your computer for the new voices to fully appear.

## Step 4: Verify New Voices
1.  Open the **School Bell System**.
2.  Go to **Settings**.
3.  In the **Default Voice** dropdown, you should now see new options.
    *   *Example*: If you installed "English (United Kingdom)", you might see "Microsoft George" or "Microsoft Hazel".

## Recommended Voices
For English, we recommend installing:
*   **English (United Kingdom)**: Adds "Microsoft George" (Male) and "Microsoft Hazel" (Female).
*   **English (Australia)**: Adds "Microsoft Catherine" (Female) and "Microsoft James" (Male).
*   **English (Canada)**: Adds "Microsoft Linda" (Female) and "Microsoft Richard" (Male).
*   **English (India)**: Adds "Microsoft Heera" (Female) and "Microsoft Ravi" (Male).

These voices work completely offline and provide good clarity for announcements.
