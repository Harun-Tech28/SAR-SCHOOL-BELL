# Bell Rings Before Voice Feature

## What This Does

You can now control how many times the bell rings BEFORE the voice announcement plays!

## Example:
- Set "Bell Rings Before Voice" to **3**
- When announcement time comes:
  1. 🔔 Bell rings (1st time)
  2. 🔔 Bell rings (2nd time)  
  3. 🔔 Bell rings (3rd time)
  4. 🎤 Voice announcement plays

## How to Use

### Option 1: Set Default for All Announcements

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Find "Bell Rings Before Voice" setting
3. Set the number (1-10)
   - **1** = Bell rings once, then voice
   - **3** = Bell rings 3 times, then voice (DEFAULT)
   - **5** = Bell rings 5 times, then voice
4. Click **Save Settings**

### Option 2: Different Settings

**Default Repeat Count**: Repeats the ENTIRE sequence (bell rings + voice)
- Example: Repeat Count = 2, Bell Rings = 3
- Result: Ring 3 times → Voice → Wait → Ring 3 times → Voice

**Bell Rings Before Voice**: How many times bell rings BEFORE voice
- This happens BEFORE each voice announcement

## Perfect for Schools!

This is great for getting students' attention:
- Ring bell 3-5 times to get everyone's attention
- Then play the voice announcement
- Students hear the bells and know to listen!

## Current Default

- **Bell Rings Before Voice**: 3 times
- **Repeat Count**: 1 time

So by default: Bell rings 3 times, then voice plays once.

## Change Anytime

Go to Settings and adjust the numbers to your preference!
